Before you can connect to the server, you will have to edit the hosts file in your operating system. 

On a Windows machine:
  1: Open Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
  2: Move the "hosts" file to a temporary directory, since it is not editable while in the current directory.
  3: Navigate to the temporary directory, and open the hosts file with notepad or notepad++. The file should look something like this
  
          # Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
          #
          # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
          #
          # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
          # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
          # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
          # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
          # space.
          #
          # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
          # lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
          #
          # For example:
          #
          #      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
          #       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

          # localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
          #	127.0.0.1       localhost
          #	::1             localhost
          
  4: At the end of the file, add this line: 10.15.17.88     www.cachemoney.com
  5: Your host file should look like below
  
          # localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
          #	127.0.0.1       localhost
          #	::1             localhost
          10.15.17.88       www.cachemoney.com
          
  6: Save the hosts file and move it back to the etc directory. Start a browser and try navigating to www.cachemoney.com to ensure that 
     it works
