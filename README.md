To edit the project:

1) Ensure you have the latest commmit.
2) In Eclipse, go to File -> Import... , then select Git -> Projects from Git
3) Either put your url or select the folder that has the project.
4) Save a new line of code, and make sure that there are uncommitted changes in GitHub Desktop.


Eclipse should detect that this project is linked to a GitHub repo.
What does that mean? Well, I'll show you... (flashbacks to COMP 55)

1) Right click the project and go to Team.
2) You will be able to commit, push, pull, and reset the project from within Eclipse! (for those who were fans of this!)
*i haven't tested this on other computers yet so this might not work (as of Feb. 8, 2017)
